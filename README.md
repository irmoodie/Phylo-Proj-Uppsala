## How to use/replicate

Use GBIFsearchquery.R to create a download request on your GBIF account (needs you to enter your login details).

Save the downloaded CSV as gbif.csv.

Download the required datasets (as indicated in RangeFinder.R) then run RangeFinder.R to generate the rangeDataset.csv (included in repo).

To generate range maps for each species, use MapGen.R along with gbif.csv
